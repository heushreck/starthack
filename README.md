# Preventing disasters before they happen - Learning to Predict Landslides in Hongkong.
Given a geo-dataset of the area Hongkong, we apply different Machine Learning techniques to classify Landslides.
Using an ensemble of Tree-based approaches, our trained model can generalize to unseen data and prevent potential upcoming Landslides.
